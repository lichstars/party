### Continuous Integration
**Continuous Integration (CI)** is a practice that focuses on allowing developers merge their changes back to the main branch as easy and often as possible. This is usually achieved by automating the build and testing process. Achieving this can prevent the integration hell that usually happens when people wait for release day to merge their changes into a release branch.

### Continuous Delivery
**Continuous Delivery (CD)** is an extension of continuous integration which emphasises the ease and speed at which you can release new changes to your customers. This can be achieved by automating the release process and simplifying a deployment of an application by the click of a button. Achieving this can give you the ability to deploy daily, weekly, fortnightly, or whenever it suits your business.

### Continuous Deployment
**Continuous Deployment (CD)** is a practice that automatically deploys your application if it passes all the stages of your production pipeline (building, testing, security checking, etc). There is no human intervention and a failed test will prevent the change from being deployed to production.
